// Documentation of conditional compilation symbols used in PDFsharp.
// Checks correct settings and obsolete conditional compilation symbols.

#if NewViewMatrix // obsolete
#error NewViewMatrix must not be defined anmore.
#endif

#if MIGRADOC  // obsolete
// empira internal only: Some hacks that make PDFsharp behave like PDFlib when used with Asc.RenderContext.
// Applies to MigraDoc 1.2 only. The Open Source MigraDoc lite does not need this define.
#error MIGRADOC must not be defined anmore.
#endif

#if NET_ZIP  // obsolete
// In .NET 2.0 GZipStream is used instead of SharpZipLib
// This does not work as anticipated.
#error Undefine 'NET_ZIP' because it has no effect anymore.
#endif

#if NET_2_0  // obsolete
#error Undefine 'NET_2_0' because earlier versions are not supported anymore.

#if Gdip  // obsolete
#error Conditional compilation symbol 'Gdip' was renamed to 'GDI'.

#error Conditional compilation symbol 'GdipUseGdiObjects' was renamed to 'UseGdiObjects'.

// Fragmentation of large object heap is a serious issue that must be tackled in the future.
// Update: .NET 4.51 can ultimately defragment LOH. So maybe we can wait and see.
#if UseMemoryStreams
// Use MemoryStream instead of byte[] to avoid large heap problems.
#error Undefine 'UseMemoryStreams' because it has no effect anymore.
#else
// Use byte[] (instead of MemoryStream) to analyse the symptoms of large heap issues.
