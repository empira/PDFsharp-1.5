    // In GDI+ the functions Save/Restore, BeginContainer/EndContainer, Transform, SetClip and ResetClip
    // can be combined in any order. E.g. you can set a clip region, save the graphics state, empty the
    // clip region and draw without clipping. Then you can restore to the previous clip region. With PDF
    // this behavior is hard to implement. To solve this problem I first an automaton that keeps track
    // of all clipping paths and the current transformation when the clip path was set. The automation
    // manages a PDF graphics state stack to calculate the desired bahaviour. It also takes into consideration
    // not to multiply with inverse matrixes when the user sets a new transformation matrix.
    // After the design works on pager I decided not to implement it because it is much to large-scale.
    // Instead I lay down some rules how to use the XGraphics class.
    //
    // * Before you set a transformation matrix save the graphics state (Save) or begin a new container
    //   (BeginContainer).
    // 
    // * Instead of resetting the transformation matrix, call Restore or EndContainer. If you reset the
    //   transformation, in PDF must be multiplied with the inverse matrix. That leads to round off errors
    //   because in PDF file only 3 digits are used and Acrobat internally uses fixed point numbers (until
    //   versioin 6 or 7 I think).
    //
    // * When no clip path is defined, you can set or intersect a new path.
    //
    // * When a clip path is already defined, you can always intersect with a new one (wich leads in general
    //   to a smaller clip region).
    //
    // * When a clip path is already defined, you can only reset it to the empty region (ResetClip) when
    //   the graphics state stack is at the same position as it had when the clip path was defined. Otherwise
    //   an error occurs.
    //
    // Keeping these rules leads to easy to read code and best results in PDF output.
